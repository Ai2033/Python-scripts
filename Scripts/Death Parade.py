He's an albino with white hair and pale skin and has a cross symbol on his pupils on both eyes. The bartender introduces himself as Decim, an arbiter of the afterlife and reveals that you are already dead and that this bar is the place where it is decided whether you go to hell or heaven. You are now asked to play a series of games in order to determine where you go now that you are dead.
